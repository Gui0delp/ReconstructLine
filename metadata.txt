about=Reconstruct linear features from points. Points can be unordered (mixed) time-wise, only spatial location of points is considered. This is NOT a simple 'connect the dots as they are in the table' mechanism (for that â€“ check Points2One plugin). Developed by NextGIS. Any feedback is welcome at https://nextgis.com/contact
